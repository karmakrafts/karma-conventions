/**
 * Configures default dependency locking for a Gradle project.
 * 
 * This function enables dependency locking for all configurations in the project,
 * which helps ensure reproducible builds by fixing dependency versions.
 * It also creates a "dependenciesForAll" task that can be used to generate
 * a comprehensive dependency report.
 * 
 * Dependency locking is particularly useful in multi-module projects to ensure
 * consistent dependency versions across all modules.
 * 
 * Example usage:
 * ```kotlin
 * project.defaultDependencyLocking()
 * ```
